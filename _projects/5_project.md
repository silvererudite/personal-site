title: Image feature aggregation using Attention mechanisms
description: I demonstrated a use case of feature aggregation to get a condensed view of an image using the concept of attention to images. I utilized pretrained CLIP embeddings which already have knowledge of images. The attention-mechanism is done by breaking the images into image patches and calculating the attention of the patch embeddings.

key_findings:
  - I built this simple project to exercise my understanding of attention mechanisms by coding up one from scratch. 
  - Interpreting image tokens using simple self-attention and multi-head attention.
