Hello! I am a Research Engineer from Bangladesh. I work with LLMs, VLMs and computer vision models. I study their architecture and underlying theory that govern their reasoning process. I like to perform rigorous experiments to verify and understand language model's complex behavious.


I occasionally publish in-depth analysis of my experiments and paper studies as blog posts here. Superficial learning causes unsatisfaction so whatever I talk about you can assume I spent a significant number of time studying. I want to practice slow research that build foundational work. A lot of my idealogies are inspired from amazing researchers that I admire. 

Please reach out if you want to discuss a research collaboration or anime.
